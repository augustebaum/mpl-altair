Matplotlib Backend for Altair Visualization Library
==================================================
[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on the [Vega and Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/) visualization grammars. This project converts Altair charts to Matplotlib objects that can be modified using the Matplotlib API, rendered as publication-qualuty figures, and integrated with Matplotlib based tools, libraries, and dashboards.
